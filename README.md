THE BEER HUB

About

This is full React JS project. The main objective of this project was to use PUNK API and pull the data and filter through the various beers on conditions given (including search). I had a great time learning about using API’s and programming in REACT. Technologies used:

•	API 

•	React Router

•	JavaScript

•	SCSS

___________________________________________________________________________
 Features
 
•	Created using REACT

•	Card based beer layout.

•	Search function with multi-layer filter

•	Beers can be filtered with conditions such as High alcohol percentage, Classic Range(the best) and its Acidic Ph(if you don’t like the extra oomph).

•	Gradient background glow on scroll.

•	Gradient cards to highlight every beer.
